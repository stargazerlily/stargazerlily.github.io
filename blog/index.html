      <p>
        Just to start off, my name is Amelie LeTierce, I am 23 years old, and I have been a student of sustainable food and farming in the online program offered by UMass Stockbridge for a little over a year. I came to this program because of my
        history working in America's front-end of produce and floriculture: the supermarket, and because of my growing interest in sustainable lifestyles, particularly growing my own veggies.  I also find that the flexible nature of asynchronous offered usually works well for me. Since enrolling I have grown tremendously as a gardener and young botanist, and I couldn't be more grateful for the range of experiences and inspiration I have gained, but as I grow I find there are many elements of plant
        science which elude my online-only, ag-centric education.

          I'm pretty dorky about loving my veggies, and I'm hoping to score some <a href="https://www.mafoodplate.org/">MA FOOD plates</a> soon, now that I have a car registered in Massachusetts. The extra registration charge goes to supporting young
          farmers like me, and it will help my car stand out now that I will be missing my lucky RI plates...

        I want to gain hands-on experience of working with plants in both research and field settings. I would love to study natural plant ecology and systematics and become familiar with the diversity of plant life on our Earth and particularly in
        my home region of New England. Ideally I would like my education to ultimately leave me with the flexibility to pursue employment in many areas of plant biology. With my experience I could be a farmer, a teacher, a florist, or a scientist,
        whichever comes most naturally with where I am at and where I am going. While researching potential internships, I specifically looked for opportunities to broaden these experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first reached out to <a href="https://www.nativeplanttrust.org/">Native Plant Trust</a>, I was not expecting they would have any immediate educational opportunities for me. I was interested in learning more about their summer
        internships, and I thought maybe I could participate as a volunteer at the tail-end of their fieldwork season. It turned out I was a little late to go on any outings, but there were a few off-season projects I was welcome to be involved in!
      </p>
      <p>
        For about two months now I have been working with the plant conservation department at <a href="https://www.nativeplanttrust.org/visit/garden-woods/">Garden in the Woods</a> in Framingham, MA. Before meeting the wonderful folks at NPT, I had
        worked in grocery and retail for 5 years, making this my first semi-professional experience in the field of plant sciences. In many ways I am as anxious as I am delighted about the prospect.

        I love hanging out with my friend dr. jessamine finch all afternoon.  I am her dutiful assistant and i help with seed bank operations.  right now she is teaching me about germination testing of the collection.  I have learned how to pour agar plates, set up trial plates, and score the germination.
